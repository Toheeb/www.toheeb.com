<h1>Introduction</h1>

I asked Hillary, not Clinton, what HTML element would you use to create a subheading? He replied, <q>if the heading is h1, I will use h2 for the subheading</q>

Just so we are clear, I picked up a book and showed him what I meant as a subheading. I wanted to be sure he wasn't mistaking subheading for the heading of a subsection.

He stood his ground and I said wrong. He looked at me perplexed and I matched him with a raised eyebrow. Then, I asked <q>how would you find out the right answer?</q> Hillary kept mute with a straight face.

You see, I expected Hillary to say <q>I'll ask Google</q> but, he didn't. Weird. Further questions revealed Hillary is a simple human. He wanted things handed over to him on a platter of gold. That's why he confessed that he prefers the sections on w3schools on how to markup layout, navigations, buttons, etc. Rather than learning this contents via HTML elements.

I wanted to say Hillary is lazy, not ready to learn to code. But then, I remembered a part of Bill Gate's quote that says <q>a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</q> Truly, Hillary found a way, his preference, unfortunately not an exhaustive resource; hence the gap in his knowledge. So, I got humbled, become emphathetic, reasoned with him, and develop his story.

As a simple human learning to code, Hillary wants a straightforward learning resource so that he doesn't have to browse all elements before knowing the suitable one to use for the content he has in mind.

And, yes, that's possible. HTML is a declarative language to the core. There are no two ways to markup a paragraph, a level one heading nor a

Stubborn Humans conjure up to 112 HTML elements to create the contents of a web document. It's inevitable dealing with <strong>semantics</strong>. Can HTML represent a particular content? If yes, what's the most specific element to use? If no, what's the least generic element to use? Yes or No, does the parent element allow such an element?

The <strong>challenge</strong> to learning semantics stems from the API Design of HTML elements. One element can be multipurpose yet insufficient for one content markup. For example, it takes the following 4 elements to markup a stylesheet meta.

- `style` attribute to specify an inline stylesheet

- `style` element to specify an embedded stylesheet

- `link` element to specify the 3 types of external stylesheets. Besides, the <code>link</code> element creates over 15 tangential Content Metas including Canonical Meta, Icon Meta and Pingback Meta.Â 

- `meta` element to specify the default stylesheet. Besides, the <code>meta</code> element creates over 10 tangential contents including Charset Meta, Description Meta, and Timeout Meta. 

Yet, learning resources explain HTML by elements-to-use before content-they-creates. Whereas, Authors think by contents-to-create before elements-to-use. A <strong>conflict</strong> of expectation.

That information fragmentation makes it hard for authors to find the appropriate elements to represent contents. You have to know all to use some. Otherwise, it <strong>results</strong> to incorrect use of elements, loss in semantics, incompatibility with user agents, and, finally, bad experience for users at unexpected times.

Marking the Web provides a distinct <strong>solution</strong> as a content-first HTML Resource. It explains HTML elements by the contents the elements create. Thereby, consolidating fragmented information to its minimum in 14 web pages.
