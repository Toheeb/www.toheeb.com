I used to dislike apps based on Javascript for the warning: <q>you need to enable javascript to use this page.</q> I'm like, handle the whole logic at the server-side. Not anymore!

Javascript, like HTML and CSS, is a core language of the web's frontend. All 3 should be enabled always. 

In fact, I now feel all logics should, by default, be at the client side so far Javascript is capable.
