Web styles have semantics to cap creativity. Like glyphs, they need to look certain way to be what they are.

A link may have a text-underline. A button has an all-round border. A tab may have a bottom border on that of the tab list, or all-but-bottom-border sitting on the bottom border of the tab list. ![](/en/images/css-interactives.png)
