title: Thoughts and Communications
---

You can think without communicating. 

But, you can't communicate without thinking. If you were to, you'd spill a raw thought. 

So, you'll always think first and you must learn to think well. Then, learn to communicate well.

No one should think for you but one can help you think. While one may communicate for you, you still need to communicate well enough to that one.

As such: learn to think well, then learn to communicate well.
