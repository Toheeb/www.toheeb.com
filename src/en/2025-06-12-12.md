title: Margin Top or Margin Bottom?
---

You can specify both Margin Top and Margin Bottom and let Margin Collapse combine adjacent margins into the larger one.

But Margin Collapse has its rules â€” it won't work all the time. 

The reliable way is to use either margin top or margin bottom.

Margin Top can do one thing that Margin Bottom can't do. Margin Top can infer space heirarchy on heading levels.
