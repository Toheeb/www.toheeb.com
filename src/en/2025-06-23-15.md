title: Need for no headings in HTML

There should be no headings in Mixes, Secondary Landmarks, header elements, and footer elements.

If header and footer elements must not contain header and footer elements as the spec says, then it must not contain headings. Headings imply Sections, and Sections imply Headers and Footers.

You can section a document or section, but you can't section <strong>a part</strong> within or outside the document.

The Primary Landmark is literally the document.

Secondary Landmarks are literally outside the document and Mixes are a part within thier landmark. They should have no sections, hence no headings.
