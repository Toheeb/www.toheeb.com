title: Why Base CSS?
---

A webpage is a web document that can be made to look like many things including an app.

There must be a Document Layout as it's a document. Users need not rely on opinionated Reader Modes of third parties.

There may be Custom Layouts in parts or full. Users should be able to switch or personalize layouts.

Meanwhile, Authors need not compromise with Classless Stylesheets for Document Layout only and Normalize Stylesheets for Custom Layouts only. Authors need a document stylesheet that is ready for custom stylesheets. 

Enter Base CSS.
