HTML learning resources are counterintuitive.

They explain HTML by what an element can do.

There are 2 problems:

- By design, one element can be multipurpose yet insufficient to markup one content. For example: a `link` element, while it does a lot, is not sufficient to create a Stylesheet Meta. This information fragmentation does not help learners. You have to know all to use some.

- More importantly, authors think by contents-to-create before elements-to-use. Reading a resource which presents by elements-to-use before contents-to-create is a conflict of expectation.

HTML by Contents is an intuitive Resource. You browse by the contents you think and get the appropriate element for it. No mental gymnastics.

The cover page provides you with a [practical approach](/en/html-by-contents/#steps) and a [conceptual approach](/en/html-by-contents/#toc) to using this resource.
