Grey.co has a fast service and slow onboarding. The login page takes like-forever to load. 

As a concerned user who happens to be a dev and who wants to promote personalizable web design, I recoded the page. Same Design but better results: 

- up to 31 times faster.

- all doc issues fixed

- personalizable with 360 color hues

- personalizable with unlimited typefaces.

- even more personalizations.
