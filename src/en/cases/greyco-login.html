      As a user and dev, who wants to promote personalizable web design, I recoded the page. Same Design but better results:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          More than 20 times faster on mobiles and more than 10 times faster on desktops. <img src="/en/images/recode-greyco-performance.png" alt="Before, LCP was 67.0 on mobiles and 12.3 on desktops. After, LCP is 2.4 on mobiles and 1.2 on desktops">
        </p>
      </li>
