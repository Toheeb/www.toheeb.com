This resource organizes HTML by contents not elements.

You will not learn to conjure elements for a content. Conjuring elements is wild. One element may create many contents and many elements may create one content.

You will just browse through an index of all contents HTML can create, choose a specific one, and see how to create it. You may also read an [overview.](/en/html-overview)
