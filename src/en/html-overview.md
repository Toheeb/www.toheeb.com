A web document has one root and two branches, like the letter Y.

The root is the html element and the branches are the head element and the body element.

<p id="branch">

The head element contains metadata while the body element contains [windows.](/en/html-windows) Each window contains [frames.](/en/html-frames)
</p>

Frames contain Blocks and Mix of Blocks. Each block contains media, forms, and breaks; optionally, via a phrase.

This is an overview of HTML, and it starts with a [boilerplate.](/en/html-boilerplate)
