# HTML by Contents (not Elements)

HTML Learning Resources are counter-intuitive.

They present elements that are available before the contents they create.

Meanwhile, we think about the contents we want to create before the elements we can use.

Element-first presentation forces us to think backwards. It increases our chances of choosing unsemantic HTML elements.

This 10-page resource, HTML by Contents, matches our mental model with a content-first presentation and baked-in semantics.
