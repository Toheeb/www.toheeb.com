Don't fake buttons.

It may look, receive focus, and perform an action like a button; still, it won't be called a button. Users using screen readers won't know they can perform an action. It becomes useless.

Beside other errors: when the <i>Fake Button</i> recieved focus, it wasn't called a button.

<strong>One other error:</strong> After pronuncing "For" as a word, it pronunced "SAAS LEADERS" by characters.

One <strong>poor solution</strong> is to name it a button. It begs the question, why re-engineer an element?

The <strong>true solution</strong> is to simply use a button element if it should really be a button.

Absence of anchor text at mazerance.com made NVDA read out the URL path and parameters; 2 issues:

- It doesn't complete the parameters because there's a character limit. 

- When a brand has the same username across social media, as it should be, NVDA reads the username without distinguishing the platforms.

<strong>Remember:</strong> every non-text media that is not a decoration should have an alternative text.

<strong>2 solutions:</strong> add a visually-hidden text; or use an ARIA label.
