<h2>Thought and Communications</h2>
</hgroup>

You can think without communicating. 

But, you can't communicate without thinking. If you were to, you'd spill a raw thought. 

So, you'll always think first and you must learn to think well. Then, learn to communicate well.

No one should think for you but one can help you think. While one may communicate for you, you still need to communicate well enough to that one.

Learn to think well, then learn to communicate well.

But you are at the same place, same work. Yet you are not stuck.

It feels like you are moving in circle, round and round, back to where you began. <svg width=".75em" height=".75em" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

What if I tell you, your reality is the reality and you only need a catalyst?

You will still go round and round; better things come with refinements. Remember your improvements, tangible or intangible, in kind or in thought; they leap you again and again.

You are not moving in circles, you are moving in springs. Your perception is only a circle if you look from the top, <svg width=".75em" height=".75em" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9.5" stroke="currentColor"/></svg> and a spring if you look from the side. <svg width=".75em" height=".75em" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

<h2>Luck</h2>
</hgroup>


Luck, by definition, is a product of chance — not effort; It's like a child choosing its parents. Since luck is by chance, you can't create luck and you can't learn how to be luckier.

Why then will a person work for a future and when the work works, by favor or not, they downplay the efforts and empasizes the role of <del>chance</del> luck — not priviledge?

<blockquote>
  <p>
    In 1651... Understanding the foolishness of alienating those below him, [Archbishop] Retz did everything he could to downplay his merit and emphasize the role of luck in his success... He wrote that these wise policies <q>produced a good effect, by lessening the envy which was conceived against me.</q>
  </p>
</blockquote>

If not ignorance, the acknowledgement of good luck after some efforts is to deflect envy; It's documented in Law 46 of 48 Laws of Power. Likewise, the acknowledgement of bad luck after some efforts is to deflect accountability. Listeners, beware!

<h2>7 Steps to Sales</h2>
</hgroup>

7 lessons from Sell like Crazy by Sabri Suby, and Traffic Secrets by Russell Brunson

1. Craft a Promotional Statement to guide your messages, partnerships, and ventures.

1. Search your Business Queries and discover the following Customer Insights from posts and comments

   - Customer Desire which is either a Need that moves them from pain or a Want that moves them towards pleasure

   - Customer Blocks which are Challenges that hardens their goal and Frustrations that stops their goal

   - Customer Concerns which are Hopes that encourages them and Fears that discourages them 

   - Customer Languages which are their Word Choices and Word Styles

   - Customer Influencers in their source of information

3. Curate your Dream-100 targets and form your Customer Avatar
 
1. Compose Business Pages targeted at your Customer Avatar with any of the following 3 closes. 

      1. Emotional Close which acknowledges the problem, promise a solution, and presents some 1st-party proofs,

     1. Rational Close which conveys problem cause, status quo, product features, product advantage, product benefits, brand guarantee, and 3rd party proofs

    1. FOMO Close which conveys consequences of no action, late action, limited availability, and proofs

    PS: Each Close should start with a hook and end with a CTA

1. Connect, appease, and engage your Dream-100 at the Distribution Channels they congregate

1. Tailor your Business Pages to that of your Dream-100 Influencer's Channels so your contents resonate to their audience – your Dream Customers

<h2>Marketing Web Creator</h2>
</hgroup>

I've touted "Web Creator is 96% more powerful than 'another website builder' based on the current milestone"; true but limiting.

The tone implies Web Creator is a better alternative but I don't want it to be yet; Not when it's incomplete. Why advocate for someone to dump a complete tool with limitations for an incomplete tool without limitations? 

I want a tone that sounds like a complementary tool. I want users of my competitors to include Web Creator to their workflow. This should help with adoption and transition.

This change needs 2 things:

- A playground to help those users generate code with a nocode interface. They would want to because they can't with their tool.

- A series of articles to show how Web Creator can be used along with top Website Builders. This onboards those users.
