The web is lost.

The [inventor acknowledged severally,](https://medium.com/@timberners_lee/marking-the-webs-35th-birthday-an-open-letter-ebb410cc7d42) [designers advocate continuously,](https://indieweb.org/) and creators grudge unknowingly.

In a twist of an event: the problem, content exploitation, lie in today's solution to yesterday's problem.

Spoiler: the culprit is not platforms but apps.


Yet, to leverage this ultimate solution, you need a web design tool that democratize the web workflow to enable a self-sufficient web for creators.

The journey to web 1.0++ had just begun with 7 projects in and out of 3 programs:

- Document the Design System for the web design tool

- Design the Product Shell for the core web languages

- Publish [HTML by Contents](/en/html-by-contents/) for the design specification of web contents

  - Develop the Word Processor for unlimited markup of web contents

- Publish CSS by Visuals for the design specification of web styles

  - Develop the Prose Stylesheet for the default styles of web contents

  - Develop the Style Panels for custom styling of web contents

- Publish JS by Functions for the design specification of web logics

  - Develop Logic Panels for custom interactions of web contents

- Dogfood the Design System for product validation
