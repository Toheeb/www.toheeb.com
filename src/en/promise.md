# Unlocking the web's promise

The web is found and lost.

You can have a site for any number of activities but at the expense of high technical costs.

Or, you can use many a platform for one to few activities but at the expense of subjections.

Technical costs is not encouraging; yet, what seems to be the solution is discouraging.

So, soon, after democratizing the web workflow, you will act all acts via your own site with no technicalities, no subjectivities, and no other form of limitations.
