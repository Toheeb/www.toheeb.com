<h2>To Javascript-only</h2>
</hgroup>


I used to dislike apps based on Javascript for the warning: <q>you need to enable javascript to use this page.</q> I'm like, handle the whole logic at the server-side. Not anymore!

Javascript, like HTML and CSS, is a core language of the web's frontend. All 3 should be enabled always. 

In fact, I now feel all logics should, by default, be at the client side so far Javascript is capable.

<h2>De-Deepfakes</h2>

AI can create a video of any influencer talking a speech you wrote. Impersonation at its peak. 

It'll be hard for Social Platforms to flag such media; there will be tools that erase any identifing metadata.

The solution is to publish your content on your web domain. Your domain becomes the source of truth.
